*X.Org Server is the X Window reference implementation, which serves as the standard for all other implementations and is generally used with Unix and Linux platforms.
*X.Org Server is the base for KDE, GNOME and CDE desktop interfaces.
*The X.Org Server platform runs on a computer with graphical displays, connects with numerous programs and serves as an intermediary between client and user applications. 
*X.Org Server receives graphical output requests from client programs, which are then displayed for users. 
*The server also receives user input from a mouse or keyboard and then transmits data to the client application.
*The client-server communication protocol uses a transparent network, allowing the client and server to run on the same or different computers. 
*Additionally, the client and server may have different architectures and OSs. Client and server communications are secured over the Internet via a data encryption mechanism known as tunneling.
